            <p>This is the first version of my Portfolio Website. This is the project that introduced me to the world of HTML & CSS. 
                Here, I found my passion for creativity with software development. It allowed me to become familiar with the
                fundamentals of HTML & CSS.

            <p>I had quite a bit of fun with this project. This is SpaceSquad, which was my introduction to Java and software development
                all-together. I became accustomed to Java syntax, OOP prinicipals and logical thinking. Not only did it help me to become
                the developer I am today, but it was such a great tool to help me visually understand the program I was creating.</p>

            <div id="break"></div>
            <p>The Lexical Analyzer project was a very challenging project for me. This project required me to create logic for accepting
                different variations of the same input and be able to handle that and produce the same formatted output. Fortunately, I was
                able to accomplish the task. It made me appreciate the complexity and hard work that goes into lower level programming such
                as the compiler.

                Guessing Game was a simple, yet fun little experiment/project. On a personal level, I know that I need to challenge myself on
                understanding the Javascript and what goes into dynamic changes on a web application. The Guessing Game allowed me to utilize
                more Javascript than HTML & CSS. Although it is nowhere near as complex as most Web Applications, it was good practice being
                able to modify the elements on a web application.

                This is ProductivityPal! It was a my end-of-the-year senior capstone project at Rollins College. I enjoyed how
                comprehensive this project was for us students to understand and practice many new conepts. Our group decide on creating an
                app for students to utilize for productivity, such as a study timer, task list, course list and a calender. We utilized both
                Front-End and Back-End components. We were able to save user information in a database, send and retreive from it, and display
                information about the user's account based on what is stored in the database under their name.
