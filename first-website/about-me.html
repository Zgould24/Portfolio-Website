        <p>
          I am currently finishing my senior year at Rollins College, earning my
          Bachelors Degree in Computer Science & Music. I have been invested and
          passionate about software development since high school, which has led
          me to pursue it in college. I have absolutely loved the challenges
          that software development has presented to me, and continues to, so
          that I may utilize my problem solving skills - combining it with my
          creative expression to form working software.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my journey at Rollins College, I have been able to work
          with languages such as Java, Python and C. These created the gateway I
          needed to expand my software knowledge on my own. Learning concepts
          such as Object-Oriented Programming, the System Development Life Cycle
          and Secure Software Engineering have not only taught me the importance
          of how systems functioned, but why they function, as well. Major
          topics such as these have also taught me important collaboration
          skills and communication skills as I have worked with many groups to
          complete assignments and other projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have narrowed my focus in the software development world towards web
          development. Here, I found that I am able to use my problem solving
          and creative skills to invest my work into a product that finds a
          balance of <u>quality</u> and <u>quantity</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to be proficient in Front-End development before I move on
          to Back-End development, where I hope to utilize my Java skills and
          expand from Java as I progress. The end goal is for me to become a
          Full-Stack developer so that I may become a versatile and resourceful
          web developer. I hope that throughout my life, my work benefits and
          inspires many.
