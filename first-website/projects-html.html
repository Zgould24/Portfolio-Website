        <h1><a href="https://github.com/Zgould24/Personal-Website">Portfolio Website</a></h1>
        <p>This website that you are currently looking at is my personal project for understanding the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and 
          JavaScript. I was very interested in this particular project because I am the type of person the outcome of my own work,
          especially if it is something that I can use and show off. Along with having interests in software development, I also enjoy
          the arts. Being able to express my creativity gives me much joy and boosts my work ethic. This project enabled me to do just
          that. This website allows me to demonstrate my skills instead of describing them. I am a visual learner by nature, so this
          approach caters to me well.</p>

        <h1><a href="https://github.com/Zgould24/CMS395-Lexical-Analyzer-Project">Lexical Analyzer</a></h1>
        <p>The Lexical Analyzer was a project assigned in a Compilers Topics class I took during my time at Rollins College. The goal was
          to simulate a working lexical analyzer from a compiler that would read syntax-correct strings from a language (in this case it was
          PL/0), hash keywords in the language, and return integer-represented values, otherwise known as "tokens". The token string would
          represent keywords, integers, and variables based on the number each one of these entities represented. The Lexical Analyzer works
          with any input, such as a PL/0 program with all correct syntax, a PL/0 program that consists of errors, a PL/0 program that is written
          all on one line, etc.

        <h1><a href="https://github.com/Zgould24/SpaceSquad-Game">SpaceSquad</a></h1>
        <p>This project was my introduction to Java, functions, libraries and a new IDE. The premise was to create any game in its entirety
          in Java. The use of the "StdDraw" library was helpful in accomplishing all of the visuals for this game. I chose to recreate the "Space Invaders"
          game concept since it was familiar to me alreay, and I was able to user that knowledge to structure the game in Java. I found that 
          choosing to make this style of game allowed me to understand the logic for event listeners, helper functions and conditions. BlueJ was
          the IDE that was used to create and run the game.
