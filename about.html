            <p class="bio">My Interest in this field
            began when I took my first Computer Science related class in High School. The 
            course had a more broadened range of Computer Science knowledge, but one of 
            the subjects of this course was Web Development. Ironically, I was not particularly 
            interested in trying to learn all of the Markup language that went into HTML and 
            CSS, but the creative side of me was fascinated with the endless possibilities of 
            the projects that I could create.<br></p>

            <p class="bio">From there I began my journey at Rollins 
            College, where I took my first Computer Science introduction class. Not only did
            I fall in love with Software Development, I was finally starting to grasp some of
            the concepts that pertain to Computer Science such as logical thinking and Object-
            Oriented Programming.<br></p>

            <p class="bio">Although Rollins College didn't offer too many
            Web Development-related courses, there were enough to lay a foundation for me. One
            of the skills that Rollins College has instilled in me is the ability to teach myself
            new concepts and ideas. That is how I have gotten myself up to this point. With the 
            knowledge that they have provided me in combination with my self-teaching ability, 
            I have been able to consider myself capable of creating a web product that, not 
            only am I satisfied with, but will please the wishes of any client, as well.<br></p>

            <p class="bio">I am exceptionally optimistic about the future that I have in Web Development, and 
            even more ecstatic that I am able to express my creative ideas and the ideas of others
            into a product that is beneficial to its users.<br></p>
